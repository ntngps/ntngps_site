*Until It Feels Like Worship* (2025) is a narrative/documentary short film directed by [Ifayomi Christine](https://www.ifayomi.com) as part of [Detroit Narrative Agency's](https://www.instagram.com/detnarrative/) Emerging Filmmaker Fellowship. From the director:
> *Until It Feel’s Like Worship* is a visual prayer that speaks to the journey one takes through remembrance, connection, culture, and healing when met with the weight of grief. Set against the backdrop of Black Detroit, with echoes of Southern matrilineal memory, it serves as a balm, beckoning the viewer to return to themselves, carrying the things that have nourished them, offering nourishment to others, and allowing themselves to be nourished in return.

The film is currently making the festival rounds; a screener is available [upon request](mailto:nadeem@ntngps.com).
