Launched in March 2021, the Obsidian Theatre Festival is a celebration of Black artists, playwrights, musicians, and performers in the heart of Detroit. Filmed before a live audience, the plays, cabarets, panel discussions, and musicals are all available to stream online for free on [their website](https://www.obsidianfest.org).

I've worked as their video editor every year since the beginning, and it's incredibly gratifying to bring these fresh stories to the world. You can watch two of my latest works below, and I encourage you to visit [their site](https://www.obsidianfest.org/) and sign up to stream the rest.
